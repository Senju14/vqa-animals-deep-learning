# VQA for Animals – Deep Learning Course Project

This project implements a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model focused on animal-related images. Given an image and a natural language question, the model returns a relevant answer. Built using PyTorch and trained with a custom dataset, this project was developed as part of a Deep Learning course.

Designed to answer questions like:
- "What animal is in the image?"
- "Is the animal running or resting?"
- "How many animals are shown?"
